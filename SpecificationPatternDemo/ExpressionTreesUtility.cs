         Expression trees represent code in a tree-like format, where each node is an expression 
         (for example, a method call or a binary operation such as x < y). You can also convert expression 
         trees into compiled code and run it. This transformation enables dynamic modification of executable 
         code as well as the execution of LINQ queries in various databases and the creation of dynamic queries.
